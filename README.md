Naruto Character Recognition Using Deep Learning
This project is a deep learning-based image classification system designed to identify the character Naruto from a collection of images. The model leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to recognize and classify images based on features that distinguish Naruto from other characters or images.

Project Overview
This project aims to create a machine learning model capable of identifying the anime character Naruto from images. The model uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for training on image data and then classifies whether a given image contains Naruto or not.

Technologies Used
Python 3.8+
TensorFlow / Keras: For building and training the neural network.
OpenCV: For image processing.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Matplotlib: For data visualization.
Pandas: For dataset management.
scikit-learn: For data preprocessing and evaluation metrics.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains labeled images of Naruto. All images were resized and preprocessed to ensure uniformity for input into the deep learning model. The images are stored in a local directory, and you can customize the dataset by adding more images of Naruto or different anime characters for multi-class classification.

Image size: Images were resized to 64x64 pixels.
Color scheme: Images were converted to RGB.
File format: JPEG or PNG images are supported.
Model Architecture
The model utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a proven architecture for image classification tasks. The CNN is composed of multiple layers, including:

Convolutional Layers: Extracts features from images.
Pooling Layers: Reduces the dimensionality of the data.
Fully Connected Layers: Combines extracted features for classification.
Activation Functions: ReLU and Softmax for non-linear transformations and final output classification.
Installation and Setup
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copiar código
git clone [<[repository_url](https://github.com/CesarRonai/DeepLearningNaruto)>](https://github.com/CesarRonai/DeepLearningNaruto)
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copiar código
cd <project-directory>
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copiar código
pip install -r requirements.txt
Training the Model
Once the environment is set up, you can train the model on your dataset.

Prepare the dataset:

Ensure that your images are organized in separate folders (e.g., Naruto/ for Naruto images and Others/ for non-Naruto images).
Run the notebook:

Open DeepLearningNaruto.ipynb in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
Execute each cell to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
Usage
After training the model, you can use it to classify new images of Naruto. The DeepLearningNaruto.ipynb notebook contains instructions on how to:

Load a new image.
Preprocess the image (resize and normalize).
Make a prediction using the trained model.
Display the result.
Results
The model achieves an accuracy of approximately X% on the test set.
Confusion matrix and other evaluation metrics are provided in the notebook to assess model performance.
